# Arduino Library to support 433.92 MHz Temperature/Humidity Sensors with Nexus/Rubiscon Protocol


![Wireless Temperature-Humidity Sensors](img/nexus_sensors.jpg)

This simple Arduino library adds a capability to decode Temperature/Humidity data sent by cheap wireless sensors similar to the ones shown on the picture. A setup should include a 433.92 MHz receiver module connected to one of the GPIO pin.

## Use
SRX882 superheterodyne receiver module is recommended for this setup. It allows to obtain a reliable signal with minimum noise from its DATA pin (pin #5).
